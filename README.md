Velum Labs embodies the ambition to democratize AI, making it accessible, understandable, and applicable for real-world scenarios. At its core, Velum Labs hosts the Thor Framework, a sophisticated, high-performance foundation for building AI agents, designed to thrive in environments where speed, security, and scalability are paramount. Thor leverages the strengths of both Rust and Golang, combining Rust's safety and concurrency with Golang's simplicity and robustness to create a unique platform for AI development.

# **Vision** 🌟

Our mission at Tela Labs is to:

Empower Developers: Provide tools and frameworks that allow developers of all levels to create, test, and deploy AI agents with ease.

Enhance Social Interaction: Utilize AI to analyze, engage, and enhance social media interactions, notably on platforms like Twitter, with agents that can understand and react to the nuances of human communication.

Promote Ethical AI: Ensure that our technology is developed with ethical considerations at the forefront, focusing on privacy, security, and responsible AI practices.

Drive Innovation: Continuously explore new methodologies, algorithms, and integrations to keep our tech stack at the cutting edge of AI development.

Our Vision is a world where AI agents are seamlessly integrated into everyday life, augmenting human capabilities and enriching digital experiences. We envision a future where AI not only responds but anticipates, learns, and adapts in real-time to the ever-evolving landscape of social media and beyond.

**Thor - An Advanced Conversational LLM Framework**

Thor is a modular, open-source conversational AI framework designed for the decentralized era. It bridges the power of advanced AI with the flexibility of systems.

Components:

- An architecture based on plugins that has hot-swappable parts
- Multi-provider LLM support, including OpenAI and bespoke connectors.
- Semantic storage enabled by PostgreSQL and pgvector
- Extendable manager system with customized conversational behaviors.

Explore Thor in its repository.

**Kit - LLM Function Calling Framework**
Toolkit is a Go and Rust package for constructing and managing LLM function calling tools. It offers a simple interface for developing AI-compatible functions and grouping them into toolkits.

Key features:

An abstract tool interface for putting LLM-compatible features into practice
Organizing relevant tools in a toolkit
Pattern of functional possibilities for configuration
Support for function parameters and returns in the JSON schema

Explore Toolkit in its repository.

# **Extension Points**
1. LLM Providers: Add new AI providers by implementing the LLM interface
type Provider interface {
    GenerateCompletion(context.Context, CompletionRequest) (string, error)
    GenerateJSON(context.Context, JSONRequest, interface{}) error
    EmbedText(context.Context, string) ([]float32, error)
}

2. Managers: Create new behaviors by implementing the Manager interface
type Manager interface {
    GetID() ManagerID
    GetDependencies() []ManagerID
    Process(state *state.State) error
    PostProcess(state *state.State) error
    Context(state *state.State) ([]state.StateData, error)
    Store(fragment *db.Fragment) error
    StartBackgroundProcesses()
    StopBackgroundProcesses()
    RegisterEventHandler(callback EventCallbackFunc)
    triggerEvent(eventData EventData)
}
